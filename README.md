## Hi there, I'm Bart ðŸ‘‹

### A CS student and beginner developer from Warsaw, Poland.

I enjoy broadening my horizons and learning new things. In 2023 I set myself a goal of completing the <i>365 Days of Code Challenge</i>. Right now I am learning web development, including React framework. I am working on developing my skills everyday with dedication, passion and a keen interest in continuous learning.
